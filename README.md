stupid gun game but stupider <br />

YOU NEED [SGG ADD ON](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/Neinguar/StupidGunGameClientAddOn/) to run this
cool features that aren't present in fvnk's version: <br />
Dinotick's houseflies mod on last weapon <br />
cool admin command to toggle houseflies for a certain person or for everyone (hs name/all 0/1) <br />
2 additional weapons (arc wave and thermal shield) <br />
The order of guns is random, but the same for every player <br />
melee will reset you one point, if you are not at the puls blade <br />
Pulse blade will take score from the killed player depening on their score <br />
The best player is highlighted for everyone so they can get focused better <br />
with !hardmode  you can view the differt levels of hard mode <br />
